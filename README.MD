1. C++11:
  *	Auto: Type inference for variables -> reduces verbosity
	* Lambdas: Anonymous function objects or concise inline functions
	* Smart Pointers: std::unique_ptr and std::share_ptr for automatic memory management, reducing raw pointer usage
	* Move semantics: Enable efficient resource transfer, avoiding copies
	* Range-based for loops: Simplified iteration
	* nullptr: Replaces NULL for safer null

2. C++14:
  * Generic Lambdas: Lambdas with auto parameters
  * Return Type Deduction: Functions can deduce return types
  * Improved constexpr: More complex compile-time computations

3. C++17:
  * Structured Bindings: Unpack tuples or structs.
  * Fold Expressions: Simplifies variadic template operations.
  * std::optional and std::variant: Safer alternatives to null checks and unions.
  * Inline Variables: Simplifies header-only libraries.
  * Filesystem Library: Standard API for file operations.

4. C++20:
  * Concepts: Constrain template types, improving readability and error messages.
  * Ranges Library: Functional-style operations on containers.
  * Modules: Replace headers for faster compilation and better encapsulation.

5. C++23:
  * ƒêeucing *this*: Explicit *this* in templates for recursive lambdas or member functions.
  * std::flat_map and std::flat_set: Efficient associative containers.
  * Extended Ranges: More algorithms and views.
  * Improved std::expected: For error handling without exceptions.
  * Stacktrace Library: Capture and query stack traces.
